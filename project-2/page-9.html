I walked out to the hill behind our house<br>

which looks positively Alaskan today,<br>

and it would be easier to explain this<br>

if I had a picture to show you,<br>

but I was with our young dog<br>

and he was running through the tall grass<br>

like running through the tall grass<br>

is all of life together,<br>

until a bird calls or he finds a beer can<br>

and that thing fills all the space in his head.<br>

You see,<br>

his mind can only hold one thought at a time<br>

and when he finally hears me call his name<br>

he looks up and cocks his head.<br>

For a single moment<br>

my voice is everything:<br>
