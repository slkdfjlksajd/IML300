      <img data-blurb="Philip--a former interpreter for U.S. soldiers in Iraq--was forced to leave his family behind in Iraq as he attempted to obtain visas for his wife and four children. Interpreters are seen as severe security threats in Iraq due to their interactions with American soldiers, and often face life-threatening discrimination. Philip risked his life traveling back to Iraq, and in 2016, finally secured visas and moved his family to Minnesota where they currently live now." src="assets/philip.jpg" alt="philip-img">
