      <h3>Philip</h3>
      <img data-blurb="Philip--a former interpreter for U.S. soldiers in Iraq--was forced to leave his family behind in Iraq as he attempted to obtain visas for his wife and four children. Interpreters are seen as severe security threats in Iraq due to their interactions with American soldiers, and often face life-threatening discrimination. Philip risked his life traveling back to Iraq, and in 2016, finally secured visas and moved his family to Minnesota where they currently live now." src="assets/philip.jpg" alt="philip-img">
      <h3>Ramon & Julio</h3>
      <img data-blurb="Ramon and his son Julio were separated when Julio was only 5 years old in 2015. Over ten years after ICE deported Ramon to Guatemala, Julio has still been unable to see his father since they were separated. According to ICE reports, between 2015-2020, over 156,000 parents with naturalized U.S.-born children were deported from the country, forcing children of all ages to grow up without their parents." src="assets/ramon.webp">
      <h3>Brizzia & Maria</h3>
      <img data-blurb="Brizzia and Maria--twin sisters--immigrated to the United States from Mexico when they were 5 years old. Growing up undocumented in Nevada, the pair had to learn how to protect their identity and avoid the immigration police; frequently skipping school and staying indoors to avoid deportation, Maria and Brizzia were forced to live their childhood with a constant threat of deportation rather than focusing on being kids." src="assets/brizzia.jpg">
