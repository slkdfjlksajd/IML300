      <h2>Project 1: Interactive Audio & Visual with p5.js</h2>
      <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/clairesmith/full/wWDtuKG9u">Final: P5.js Cat Band</a>
      <p>Drawn using photoshop, these cats create an interactive funk band that the user may mix and play with as they please. The background and design elements are meant to create a fun atmosphere, with the background demonstrating the utilization of for loops to create a disco-like feel. The cats themselves are intentionally cartoonish to add a sense of character and lightness to the music. Click on each cat to see what happens!</p>
      <h2>Project 2: HyperNarrative</h2>
      <a href="https://slkdfjlksajd.github.io/IML300/project-2/index.html">Final: Self-Portrait of A Human</a>
      <p>This project is inspired by the poem "Self-Portrait at 28" by David Berman. Every year, I take the time to write a similarly-structured poem as a self-inventory on my own feelings about my personal life and where I am. This project is meant to be a similar questionnaire in self-reflection, with hard-hitting questions that are intentionally vague to leave more room for introspection. The split background is done using P5.js in a way to represent the change between how we sketch life through our eyes and feelings, and what it may look like in reality. As we go through our own journeys, we sketch our own concepts of the world around us, and thus should have a place to record these sketches. This project is meant to be one of many ways to record your own sketch of your life.</p>
