        This is my website for <i>IML300 | Introduction to Creative Web Design</i>. Currently studying at the USC School of Cinematic Arts, I aspire to use code for self-reflection of our communities, worlds, and selves.

      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <h2>Project 1: Interactive Audio & Visual with p5.js</h2>
      <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/clairesmith/full/wWDtuKG9u">Project 1: P5.js Cat Band</a>
      <p>Drawn using photoshop, these cats create an interactive funk band that the user may mix and play with as they please. The background and design elements are meant to create a fun atmosphere, with the background demonstrating the utilization of for loops to create a disco-like feel. The cats themselves are intentionally cartoonish to add a sense of character and lightness to the music. Click on each cat to see what happens!</p>
      <h2>Project 2: HyperNarrative</h2>
      <a href="https://slkdfjlksajd.github.io/IML300/project-2/index.html">Project 2: Self-Portrait of A Human</a>
      <p>This project is inspired by the poem "Self-Portrait at 28" by David Berman. Every year, I take the time to write a similarly-structured poem as a self-inventory on my own feelings about my personal life and where I am. This project is meant to be a similar questionnaire in self-reflection, with hard-hitting questions that are intentionally vague to leave more room for introspection. The split background is done using P5.js in a way to represent the change between how we sketch life through our eyes and feelings, and what it may look like in reality. As we go through our own journeys, we sketch our own concepts of the world around us, and thus should have a place to record these sketches. This project is meant to be one of many ways to record your own sketch of your life.</p>
      <h2>Project 3: Networked Care</h2>
      <a href="https://slkdfjlksajd.github.io/IML300/project-3/index.html">Project 3: We The People</a>
      <p>This website is designed to be an informative platform for individuals to learn more about the perspective of immigrants traveling to and residing in the United States. Aimed to reduce ignorance and negative stereotypes towards undocumented immigrants, this website provides a brief glimpse into major xenophobic legislation throughout U.S. history and provides insight to real life stories of individuals living in the U.S. today. Links to external sites providing more information for current residents at risk of racial discrimination from ICE are included as well. This project is an homage to the immigrant families and individuals who face relentless marginalization in this country since its first establishment, and is meant to play a very small part in bridging the gap between communities who may have much more in common with each other than they may believe.</p>

      <h1>Vibe Coding</h1>
      <p>Vibe coding this semester provided an interesting way to explore the weekly readings. Rather than a standard reflection, having to think deeply about the concepts and then apply them was something that forced me to digest the readings in a unique way. The AI component made it easy to create a base to explore my ideas without spending excessive time building a structured website first. It was also an interesting challenge working with different Vibe Coding sites, as some were more responsive to my prompts than others. I found Lovable to be the most receptive to my ideas, while Claude crashed very often. Vibe Coding is an interesting space to explore ideas, but still requires a lot of development for use as a serious professional site builder.</p>
      <a href="https://claude.ai/share/db4952aa-0ceb-46f2-8712-377d5a23b1a2">Vibe Coding Experiment 1: Origami</a>
      <p>This experiment had ai generate a website with origami tutorials. Although it succeeded in providing clear directions, it lacked the ability to provide accurate images of both the final product and steps within the tutorial. Future edits should work to correct this, ensuring coherent and communicative instructions.</p>
      <a href="https://v0.app/chat/text-to-poem-t8krb1O1ISm?utm_source=cesmith-8401&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=share_chat&ref=U8HFBA">Vibe Coding Experiment 2: Black Hole</a>
      <p>This experiment allows the user to type whatever they wish and then see it spiral into a black hole upon pressing enter. After reading Black Gooey Universe I was inspired by its description of black as a growing, inexplicable entity. The space and black theme made me think of black holes, and thus create this experiment as a way for the user to visualize anything they type disappear forever as a cathartic experience</p>
      <a href="https://v0.app/chat/matrix-spider-game-n7RGXjM0xgq">Vibe Coding Experiment 3: Matrix Spider Crawler</a>
      <p>This vibe code experiment allows users to act as a spider crawling around the web for points. It is inspired by the idea of the first website ever made, and the literal spider web resembling the world wide web.</p>
      <a href="https://v0.app/chat/third-person-security-game-iO9hcijPXHz">Vibe Coding Experiment 4: Security Surveillance</a>
      <p>This vibe code experiment is inspired by the criticism of surveillance in modern society. The user is able to explore a liminal world through the lens of security cameras only, evoking the sense that they are being watched.</p>
      <a href="https://v0.app/chat/ruined-art-gallery-gqekpNFqc9u">Vibe Coding Experiment 5: Distorted Museum</a>
      <p>This experiment allows the user to explore a distorted museum with glitched art and a distinct lack of other patrons. Meant to be a criticism of perfectionism in art, this code allows the user to explore without judgement or pressure.</p>
      <a href="https://lovable.dev/projects/650710dd-94ac-4934-ae0f-4e53b08c8d95?permissionView=main">Vibe Coding Experiment 6: Housing Visualization</a>
      <p>This experiment is a data visualization of the housing crisis, showing clusters of where homelessness is most prevalent. It is a statement to what data scientists choose to ignore in order to visualize the narrative they wish to sell rather than the raw truth.</p>
      <a href="https://mystic-reflection-words.lovable.app">Vibe Coding Experiment 7: Magic Mirror</a>
      <p>This experiment visualizes text input from the user into a mirror image using the device's camera. The user is able to see their words appear warped and stylized directly on their faces.</p>
      <a href="https://v0.app/chat/text-to-poem-t8krb1O1ISm?utm_source=cesmith-8401&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=share_chat&ref=U8HFBA">Vibe Coding Experiment 8: Text to Poem</a>
      <p>This experiment takes text user input and redefines it as a poem. Thus, the user is able to find art and beauty through their thoughts, and take what may be a jumble of words and recycle it into art.</p>
      <a href="https://v0.app/chat/nature-vs-technology-dF14yb2KYS9?ref=U8HFBA">Vibe Coding Experiment 9: Data Vines</a>
      <p>This code allows the user to assume the role of nature fighting against a data center. As the user moves plant vines throughout the canvas, they get stronger and brighter, fighting against the surrounding technology and circuits.</p>
      <a href="https://neon-morph-display.lovable.app">Vibe Coding Experiment 10: LED Wall</a>
      <p>This experiment features an LED wall that features the user's text input. The text slowly morphs and glitches into its own set of words and phrases.</p>
